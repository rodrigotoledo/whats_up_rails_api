# WhatsApp Clone API Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a backend API for a WhatsApp clone application using Ruby on Rails. The API will provide essential functionalities for messaging, group chats, media sharing, and more. Please note that user authentication is fixed and not dynamic.

## Features
- Messaging System: Sharing messages
- Last Conversations: Last conversation between UserAdmin and other users


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git@github.com:rodrigotoledo/whats_up_rails_api.git`
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Setup the database: `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`
4. Start the server: `rails s -p 3001`

## Usage
1. Since user authentication is fixed, no registration or login is required.
2. Use the port number like 3001 because it's fixed in the project NuxtJS
3. Need to configure database
4. Depends of the Redis configuration
